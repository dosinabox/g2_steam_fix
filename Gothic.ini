; the driver version 12.41 does not have this problem. if you you have this version installed you may set this to 0 in order to activate the better looking
; w buffer. Driver versions later than 30.82 may not have this problem either.

zSyncAmbientCol=0
; ... some grafic drivers have problems with gothics way to access the ambient lightning on a per object base but want the ambient
; light on a per scene base. this is a driver bug! if there occurs heavily lightning flickering with objects, you might set this setting
; to "1" to synchronize the ambient color after each object. this forces the driver to flush the scene after each objects which can
; seriously degrade performance (especially if you activate antialiasing!)

radeonHackAmbientColBug=0
; ... the radeon 9700 has known problems with accessing the ambient lightning on a per object base, thus using the above "zSyncAmbientCol"
; Feature automatically. By activating the workaround for this card, performance may drop about 10%. Fullscene antialiasing does not work
; fast enough on this card until ATI fixes the ambient col driver bug.
; if you set this setting to "0" and no object lightning flickering occurs, ATI has probably managed to fix the problem and you may enable antialiasing

ZNEARVALUE=-1
; ... with this setting you may fine-tune the distant-value of the near clipping plane. some cards may accept more aggresive near z values then the default calculated

; workaround for most geforce 3/4 users as the flicker polys are more annoying. moreover you can't see through walls with this workaround any more
; (default: 1)

zMaxFPS=0
; ... some rare gfx hardware may have problems with gothics way to access the timer, resulting in jerky animations.

; there is no real need to deactivate the keys (moreover, disallowing those keys is more of a hack than a feature).
; this feature is untested and unsupported.

zSmoothMouse=0
; ... with this setting you can smooth your mouse movements by averaging the last [n] frame moves. higher values result in laggier but smoother mouse response.
; (default: 3) ATTENTION: modifying this value may result in different gameplay.

zMusic16ChannelsOnly=0
; ... if you have 256 MB or less memory, you can force the music system to use only 16 channels, thus killing several instruments and performances.

; use 16 channels.

zInventoryItemsDistanceScale=1.3
; ... some rare grafic cards have a high near clipping value resulting in inventory items not being visible (esp. if you have the cursor focus on it)
